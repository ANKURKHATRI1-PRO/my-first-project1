# Simple Calculator using Tkinter
Project Overview:-
This project is Graphical User Interface(GUI) Calculator built using Python's Tkinter library. it allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations, as well as some advanced functions like square, cube, and trigonometric calculations. the calculator is designed with an intutive interface that mimics the functionality of a standard calculator.

# Features
* Basic Arithmetic Operations:
  Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
  * Advanced Funtions:
    . Square(x2)
    . CUbe(x3)
    . Percentage(%)
    *Trigonometric Functions:
    sine(sin), cosine(cos), tangent(tan).
    * Backspace functionality to delete the last character.
    * User-Friendly Interface: Simple and clean design with bottons that are easy to click.

# Installation
 * Prerequisites:
   . Ensure you have Python installed on your system. this project uses the Tkinter library, which comes pre-installed with Python.

# Steps:
1. Clone the repository: https://github.com/ANKURKHATRI1-PRO/my-first-project1.git
2. Run the Calculator: https://github.com/ANKURKHATRI1-PRO/my-first-project1/blob/main/calculator.py

# Usage
. Launch the Calculator by running the calculator.py script
. Use the buttons on the interface to perform calculations.
. Special functions like square, cube, and trigonometric operations are also available.

# Code Structure
* calculator.py: the main script that contains the logic for the calculator.
  * Funtions:
    . BtnClick(number): Handles the input of numbers and operators.
    . buttonClear(): Clears the input field.
    . BtnEquals(): Evaluates the expression and displays the result.
    . BtnSquare(), BtnCube(): Calculate the the square and cube of the current input.
    BtnSin90, BtnCos(), BtnTan(): Perform trigonometric calculations.
    . BtnBackspace(): Removes the last character from the input field.
